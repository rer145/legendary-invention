The Monkey King!

The day I saw the Monkey King {{verb}}. It as one of the most interesting days of the year. I still cannot believe my {{body-part-plural}}. 

The Monkey King {{verb-past-tense}} one of the largest {{noun}} I had seen in a long time. The funniest thing was when he {{verb-past-tense}} {{persons-name}} in a huge pile of {{noun-plural}}.

After he did that, the king played chess on his brother's {{noun}} and then combed his {{adjective}} hair with a comb made out of old {{noun-plural}}.

Later that same day, I saw the Monkey King dance {{adverb}} in front of an audience of kangaroos and wombats.
