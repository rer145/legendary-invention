The Ant and the Grasshopper

In a field one summer's day a {{noun}} was {{ing-verb}} about, {{ing-verb}} and {{ing-verb}} to its heart's content. A(n) {{noun}} {{verb}} by, bearing along with great difficulty a(n) {{noun}} it was taking to the {{noun}}.

"Why not come and {{verb}} with me," said the {{noun}}, "instead of {{ing-verb}} that {{noun}}?"

"Why bother about the {{noun}}?" said the {{noun}}; we have plenty of {{noun}} at present." But the {{noun}} went on its way and continued its {{noun}}. When the {{noun}} came the {{noun}} had no {{noun}} and found itself very {{adjective}}, while it saw the {{noun}} {{ing-verb}} every day the {{noun}} it had collected in the {{noun}}. Then the {{noun}} said:

"It is best to prepare for the days of necessity."
