the Tortoise and the Hare

The {{noun}} was once boasting of his speed before the other {{noun-plural}}. "I have never yet been {{verb}}," said he, "when I put forth my full {{noun}}. I challenge any {{noun}} here to race with me."

The {{noun}} said {{adverb}} "I accept your {{noun}}."

"That is a {{adjective}} {{noun}}," said the {{noun}}; "I could {{verb}} round you all the way."

"Keep your {{ing-verb}} till you've {{verb}}," answered the {{noun}}. "Shall we {{verb}}?"

So a start was made. The {{noun}} {{verb}} off at once, but soon stopped and, to show his contempt for the {{noun}}, lay down to have a {{noun}}. Meanwhile, the {{noun}} {{verb}} on and on and when the {{noun}} {{verb}} from his {{noun}}, he saw the {{noun}} near the {{noun}} and could not catch up in time to {{verb}} the {{noun}}. Then the {{noun}} said:

"Slow and steady wins the race."
